        <h3>Visual identity</h3>
        <p>Visual identity is a powerful tool that can shape customer perception. It can help you convey a positive and correct message, but it can also "help" you send the wrong or undesirable message.
          Scary Frog Graphics intervenes to avoid the latter effect.
          Visual identity represents the totality of images and graphic elements used to differentiate you in the market. Its role is to create an emotional connection with potential and current clients and to inform them about your activity.
          
          A few of the most important elements for creating your own visual identity:
          <br>LOGO: Scary Frog builds the logo you need, all you have to do is tell us what you'd like it to represent.</br>
          <br>CULORS: Are you sure you know what colors suit you best? Okay, we’ll use those, but we’ll also come up with a suggestion.</br>
          <br>FONT: We prepare the clearest and most representative font for you to present your slogan at the highest standard.</br>
         <br> IMAGES: We’ll just tell you this: “You don’t have time to worry about this.” The images will be crafted exactly to your needs. Just give us the idea, and the rest is as good as done.</br>   </p>
